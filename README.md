## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is **not** intended as a standalone working project; instead, it serves as a showcase of knowledge pertaining to specific technology(-ies). As a result, much of the standard documentation, including the build process, has been omitted and the project itself serves no greater purpose.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages using Vite and React. It is compiled into static files through GitHub Actions.
